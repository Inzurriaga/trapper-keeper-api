## Background/About

### This 10-day project asked teams of 3 people to create a backend for our application.  It was our first foray into the world of Node.js, Express and creating endpoints for our front-end to utilize.  This project was a chance to solidify our knowledge of using Redux and Thunks inside a React application, explicitly route pathways using Router, as well as implement a Jest/Enzyme test suite for both the back-end and front-end.
